Generate fault matrix

TOOL DESCRIPTION:

1. combine_fault_data.c		
	transforms raw data created by scripts which contains differences 
	between faulty versions into the fault matrix format

2. extract_fault.awk		
	awk script which extracts nth faults from FaultSeeds.h file

3. extract_from_script.awk		
	awk script which extracts a single test run from the 
	mts generated run-and-diff script


4. extract_run.awk

5. gen_newVer.c			
	generates newVer file with all ones

6. gen_temp_file.c			
	generates temp file or temp directory in /tmp

7. get_data_for_fault_matrix.sh	
	low level script which creates fault matrix for a given program

8. get_data_for_fault_matrix_version.sh	
	low level script which creates fault matrix for a given program 
	for a  given version and a given fault

9. make_fault_matrix.sh		
	high level script which creates fault matrix for a given program

10. make_fault_matrix_with_names.sh
        high level script which creates fault matrix for a given program
        and same as make_fault_matrix.sh except extra parameters
        (see INSTRUCTION section below and README file for more details)

11. get_fault_matrix_stats.c	
	print statistics about fault matrix

12. make_newVer_vers.sh		
	low level script which generates newVer files for a given program 
	for all versions

13. make_newVer.sh			
	high level script which generates newVer files for a given program 
	and a given version

14. process_diffs.awk		
	awk script which processes output of run-and-diff script into part of 
	intermediate format used by combine_fault_data mts copy of binary 
	program which creates run-all and run-and-diff scripts 
	(can be external to those tools)


INSTRUCTIONS:

1) type "make build"

2) run "make_fault_matrix.sh <prog> <number of versions>" for 
   	all needed programs, or
   
   run "make_fault_matrix_with_names.sh <prog> <version start> 
	<number of versions> <test universe file> <fault matrix file>" 
	for all needed programs

3) run "make_newVer.sh <prog> <number of versions>" for all needed programs

4) run "get_fault_matrix_stats <fault matrix>" to get fault matrix statistics

NOTE: Read README file for more details.
