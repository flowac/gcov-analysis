;;; Commentary:

;; We need nothing special to support English on Emacs.  Selecting
;; English as a language environment is one of the ways to reset
;; various multilingual environment to the original settting.

;;; Code

(defun setup-english-environment ()
  "Reset multilingual environment of Emacs to the default status.
See the function `reset-language-environment' for more detail."
  (interactive)
  (reset-language-environment))

(set-language-info-alist
 "English" '((tutorial . "TUTORIAL")
	     (charset ascii)
	     (sample-text . "Hello!, Hi!, How are you?")
	     (documentation . "\
Nothing special is needed to handle English.")
	     ))

;; Make "ASCII" an alias of "English" language environment.
(set-language-info-alist
 "ASCII" (cdr (assoc "English" language-info-alist)))
